%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LOAD AMS LaTeX Packages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Using the "amsart" or "amsbook" document class instead of the standard LaTeX "article" document class
% provides all (or at least most) of the AMS math macros. However, it also puts a colon in the description
% list environment, which I don't like.

\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsfonts}

% Added by EGP for script fonts

\usepackage[mathscr]{euscript}

% Added by EGP for script L for a linear operator: \mathscr{L}

\usepackage{mathrsfs}

% This package provides an arrow, \longrightarrow, that is longer than AMSMATH's \xrightarrow and
% \xrightarrow.

\usepackage{extarrows} % (extensible arrows)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SET UP PAGE PARAMETERS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% EGP's preferred page style for notes, homework assignments, exams, etc.

% Margins, paragraph indents, space between paragraphs if any, etc. Good references include page 85 of
% "The LaTeX Companion" by Frank Mittelbach and Michael Goossens and page 260 of "Math Into LaTeX" by
% George Gratzer.

% Enlarge the width and height of the printed page

\setlength{\textwidth }{7.50 in}
\setlength{\textheight}{9.25 in}

% Space between the end of the odd and even side margins and the beginning of the text.

\setlength{\oddsidemargin }{0.00 in}
\setlength{\evensidemargin}{0.00 in}

% The side margins are 1.0 inch plus \hoffset and the top margins is 1.0 inch plus \voffset.
% According to "The LaTeX Companion" the default values are \hoffset = 00 pt and \voffset = 00 pt.

\setlength{\hoffset}{-0.50 in}

% This is the width of the top margin plus one inch

\setlength{\voffset}{-0.50 in}

% If there is no header in this document, set each of the following values to zero. According to "Math
% Into LaTeX"  by George Gratzer the default values for LaTeX's article documents are \headsep = 25pt,
% \headheight = 12pt, and  \topmargin = 16pt.

\setlength{\headsep   }{12pt}

% Package Fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt): Make it at least 14.0pt.

\setlength{\headheight}{14pt}

\setlength{\topmargin }{00pt}

% This is the amount of space between the last line on the page and the footer. According to "The LaTeX
% Companion" and "Math Into LaTeX" the default value is \footskip = 30 pt.

\setlength{\footskip}{0.50 in}

% I like space between paragraphs, since it makes the document more readable. However, this does not seem
% to change the spacing between paragraphs contained in an item of a list.

\setlength{\parskip}{12pt}

% Comment out the following line to use the default amount to indent the first line of each paragraph.

\setlength{\parindent}{00pt}

% \fboxsep is the distance between the edge of a box and the text the box contains.

\setlength{\fboxsep}{10pt}

% There is no need for BibTeX in this exam so I turned it off, since it creates unwanted files.

\let\nobibtex = t

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Load The GRAPHICX Package %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The best reference I have found for including graphics in figures and especially manipulating captions
% and subcaptions is "The LaTeX Companion" by Frank Mittelbach and Michel Goossens. The following packages
% are described there.

% WARNING: PDFTeX does not recognize eps files. They MUST be converted to PDF files.

\usepackage{graphics}

\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png}

% This tells LaTeX to look in the subdirectory ./Figures for my PDF files. Note that the folder name must
% be in braces {./Figures}, even if there is only one folder in the list.

\graphicspath{{./00Figures/}}

% LaTeX macro package to print the date and the time of day.

% There are various declarations that change the effect of \today. The change can be localized by placing
% the declaration within a group.
%
%  <Day> <Month> <Year> formats:
%
%   \longdate   The declaration "\longdate" will redefine \today to produce the current date displayed in
%               the form
%
%               Wednesday 8th March, 2000
%
% if the package option dayofweek is used (Default), or
%
%               8th March, 2000
%
% if the package option nodayofweek is used.
%
%   \shortdate  The declaration "\shortdate" will redefine \today to produce the current date displayed in
%               the form Wed 8th Mar, 2000 if the package option dayofweek is used, or
%
%               8th Mar, 2000
%
% if the package option nodayofweek is used.

\usepackage[long]{datetime}

% The current time is displayed using the command \currenttime. The format can be changed using the
% declaration \settimeformat{<style>}, where <style> is the name of the format. Available formats are:
%
%   xxivtime     Twenty-four hour time in the form 22:28 (Default)
%
%   ampmtime     Twelve hour time in the form 10:28pm
%
%   oclock       Displays the current time as a string, e.g. Twenty-Eight minutes past Ten in the afternoon.

\settimeformat{xxivtime}

% This is the day that I wrote the last version of this exam, assuming I remembered to update this date.

\newdate{Date-Written}{01}{09}{2016}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LOAD THE HYPERREF PACKAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The basic usage with the standard settings is straightforward. Just load the package in the preamble, at
% the end of all the other packages but prior to other settings.

% From the `Introduction' to the hyperref manual: Make sure it comes last of your loaded packages, to give
% it a fighting chance of not being over-written, since its job is to redefine many LATEX commands.
% Hopefully you will find that all cross-references work correctly as hypertext. For example, \section
% commands will produce a bookmark and a link, whereas \section* commands will only show links when paired
% with a corresponding \addcontentsline command.

\usepackage[bookmarksopen=false]{hyperref}

% Set the internal hyperref links, such as equation numbers, to black for photocopying the exam. Wikibooks
% has an article on color names at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Colors

\hypersetup{linkcolor=blue}

% bookmarksopen=true means only level 1. % are displayed.% Setup hyperref parameters. See the hyperref manual
% for details.
