# There are several global variables that have to do with what
# time system we want to work in and what the end time is. We
# also designate an output directory.

set Use years in output instead of seconds = true
set Start time                             = 0

# Then there are variables that describe the tolerance of

# at the surface of the domain (for the current geometry, the

set Nonlinear solver scheme                = IMPES
#set Linear solver tolerance                = 1e-7

# Then come a number of sections that deal with the setup
# of the problem to solve. The first one deals with the
# geometry of the domain within which we want to solve.
# The sections that follow all have the same basic setup
# where we select the name of a particular model (here,
# the box geometry) and then, in a further subsection,
# set the parameters that are specific to this particular
# model.

subsection Geometry model
  set Model name = box

    set Y repetitions = 16
  end
end


# The next section deals with the initial conditions for the
# temperature (there are no initial conditions for the
# velocity variable since the velocity is assumed to always
# be in a static equilibrium with the temperature field).
# There are a number of models with the 'function' model
# a generic one that allows us to enter the actual initial
# conditions in the form of a formula that can contain
# constants. We choose a linear temperature profile that
# matches the boundary conditions defined below plus
# a small perturbation:
subsection Initial conditions
  set Model name = function

  subsection Function
    set Variable names      = x, z
    set Function constants  = T1=1.5E3, L=6E6, D=2E6, pi=3.14159265359, Blsize=2e5, k=3, A=0.05, T_ref=0.75E3

  end
end


# Then follows a section that describes the boundary conditions
# for the temperature. The model we choose is called 'box' and
# allows to set a constant temperature on each of the four sides
# of the box geometry. In our case, we choose something that is
# heated from below and cooled from above. (As will be seen
# in the next section, the actual temperature prescribed here
# at the left and right does not matter.)

subsection Boundary temperature model

    set Right temperature  = 0
    set Top temperature    = 0       # T_0
  end
end


# We then also have to prescribe several other parts of the model such as
# which boundaries actually carry a prescribed boundary temperature, whereas
# all other parts of the boundary are insulated (i.e., no heat flux through
# these boundaries; this is also often used to specify symmetry boundaries).

subsection Model settings
  set Fixed temperature boundary indicators   = bottom, top # left, right 

  # The next parameters then describe on which parts of the
  # boundary we prescribe a zero or nonzero velocity and
  # on which parts the flow is allowed to be tangential.
  # Here, all four sides of the box allow tangential
  # unrestricted flow but with a zero normal component:

  set Zero velocity boundary indicators       = 
  set Prescribed velocity boundary indicators =
  set Tangential velocity boundary indicators = top, bottom, left, right

  # The final part of this section describes whether we
  # want to include adiabatic heating (from a small
  # compressibility of the medium) or from shear friction,
  # as well as the rate of internal heating. We do not
  # want to use any of these options here:
