New: The 'initial profile' adiabatic conditions plugin was
renamed to 'compute profile' as it can
now use a function to change the adiabatic surface pressure
and temperature over time. If this option is used the 
adiabatic reference profile will be recomputed for every
timestep based on the new function values. If the new
option is not set the behavior is unchanged.
